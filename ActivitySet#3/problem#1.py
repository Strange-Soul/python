"""Problem 1: Rectangle Area
Develop a program that, given as input the cartesian coordinates of three vertices of a rectangle,
reports the area of that rectangle. You will recall that the area of a rectangle is the product of
the lengths of any two adjacent sides.
Input: The first line contains a positive integer n indicating how many rectangles are to be
analyzed. Each rectangle is described on a single line via six real numbers, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3,
and y3, separated by spaces. These provide the coordinates of three of the rectangleâ€™s vertices,
namely P1(x1, y1), P2(x2, y2), and P3(x3, y3).
Output: For each rectangle provided as input, report its area.
Sample input
------------
3
0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 1.0 0.0
-1.0 2.0 3.0 5.0 1.0 1.0
5.0 9.0 -0.5 0.0 7.5 5.0
Resultant output
----------------
Area of rectangle with vertices (0.0,0.0),(0.0,1.0),(1.0,0.0) is 1.0
Area of rectangle with vertices (-1.0,2.0),(3.0,5.0),(1.0,1.0) is 10.0
Area of rectangle with vertices (5.0,9.0),(-0.5,0.0),(7.5,5.0) is 44.5 """
